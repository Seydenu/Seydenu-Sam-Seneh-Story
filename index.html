<h4> WHY I ATTENDED K.I.T?</h4>
<body>If you actually took note of my first two hobbies, you'll understand that learning <strong>Coding</strong> and <strong>Writing HTML</strong> are things that i really admired and wanted to do, so i've been searching for somewhere <strong>unique</strong> to learn it.
There are so many schools that teach I.T in liberia, schools like: BLUECREST, STARZ, and some more. It's commonly known that you can stay 4years at such schools and you might not even be able to do a proper coding.
But when i heard about the K.I.T, I visited them on their campus and asked them to run me through their curriculum. After that I became so excited and realizes that i've found exactly what i've been looking for all these years.
I decided to enroll and i can confirm that youre reading a story of one of the next <strong>best software engineers</strong> you'll start seeing. </body>
